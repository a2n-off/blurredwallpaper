## Description

Blur the wallpaper if a windows is active.

### main feature

- live thumbnail preview
- keep all the behavior of the default `image` plugin made by kde like :
    - auto apply the wallpaper on click
    - add color and blur option in function of the positioning
- give you the ability to deactivate the effect
- give you the ability to change the blur radius and the animation delay

### history
My own code for replacing [inactiveblur](https://github.com/Zren/plasma-wallpapers/tree/master/inactiveblur) that it seems to be abandoned.

I have duplicated the default KDE `image` plugin so all the default effect and behavior is still present.

## Installation

Place the source (`a2n.blur` folder) in `~/.local/share/plasma/wallpapers/` or dl via [the KDE store](https://www.pling.com/member/608647/)

## Configuration

| Name | Description | Result |
|--|--|--|
| Active Blur | If you want the effect or not | The effect is active or not |
| Blur Radius | Give you the possibility to customize the blur radius | The blur is stronger or weaker |
| showDesktop | Give you the possibility to customize the delay of the animation | The blur appears and disappears more quickly or less quickly |
