## Description

Blur the wallpaper if a windows is active.

### main feature

- live thumbnail preview
- keep all the behavior of the default `image` plugin made by kde like :
    - auto apply the wallpaper on click
    - add color and blur option in function of the positioning
- give you the ability to deactivate the effect
- give you the ability to change the blur radius and the animation delay
- `new` the slideshow wallpaper type is available too 

### history

My own code for replacing [inactiveblur](https://github.com/Zren/plasma-wallpapers/tree/master/inactiveblur) that it seems to be abandoned.

I have duplicated the default KDE `image` plugin so all the default effect and behavior is still present.

## Installation

- Download the last release and extract it and place the folder into `~/.local/share/plasma/wallpapers/` next you need to rename it into `a2n.blur`
- Download via [the KDE store](https://www.pling.com/p/2017888/)
- Install it via the wallpaper plugin ("get new plugin" button into Desktop Folder Settings)
